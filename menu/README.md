The simple javascript project to filter selected dishes based on breakfast,lunch,dinner...
I learned to make this project from 'Coding Addict' youtube channel and also used some codes and pictures from the videos...
Great tutorials...

UPDATE: added a new feature to automatically add new category buttons according to the dish category.Supposs we add a dish with category dinner('dinner'which is not present till now int the category) then It will only show in 'all' button but we will not get any other button for dinner category.So,add the new feature to auto add the button depending upon the new category.
