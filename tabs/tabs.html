                        Butter chicken originated in Delhi, the capital territory of India,
                         sometime during the 1950s. During this time, a man named Kundan 
                         Lal Gurjal operated a restaurant in the city.
                         After fleeing from political upheaval in another region of India.
                         The dish, which is also called Murgh Makhani in Hindi, is without 
                         question the most popular dish to emerge from India; it may even be
                          one of the most popular dishes in the world.
